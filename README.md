MLTrimEnabler
=============

This script enables the TRIM functionality on your SSD. It's based on the instructions from http://digitaldj.net/2011/07/21/trim-enabler-for-lion/. You need to be running Mac OS X 10.8.2+ for this script to work. You need to run this script everytime your Mac gets a point upgrade, i.e. an update from 10.8.2 to 10.8.3.

Do not run this on earlier versions of Mac OS X. If there is a demand for earlier Mac OS X support, email me and I'll add it to the script (when time permits).

To run the script, launch Terminal.app and run the following command {{{ sudo enable_trim.sh }}}.
